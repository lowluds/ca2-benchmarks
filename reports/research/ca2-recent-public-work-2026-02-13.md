## Suggested Next Targets

1. Build reproducible Windows baseline around app-graphics3d GPU paths (gpu_vulkan, draw2d_opengl) because these are active and likely performance-sensitive.
2. Remove hardcoded SDK assumptions in public samples (for example fixed Vulkan SDK paths in continuum/CMakeLists.txt) to increase contributor success rate.
3. Add a small benchmark scene and timing capture script so any optimization can be validated with before/after evidence.
